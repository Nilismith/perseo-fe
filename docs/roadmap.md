## Short term

## Medium term

The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the medium term, typically within the subsequent
release(s) generated in the next **9 months** after next planned release:

-   Rule scope beyond subservice: support dynamic creation of EPL context associated to notification path
-   Accept scripts and java snipets
-   No signal rules based in NGSIv2 API instead of MongoDB direct access #549

## Long term

The following list of features are proposals regarding the longer-term evolution of the product even though development
of these features has not yet been scheduled for a release in the near future. Please feel free to contact us if you
wish to get involved in the implementation or influence the roadmap

-   Support for geospatial analysis (geo-fencing, point-based actions, movement-based actions)
-   Rule templates (i.e. having a rule template that can be instantiated to create particular instances of the rule).
    The idea is be able to create complex rules only providing some parameters.
-   Include AI models as part of the rule (condition).

## Done

-   Full support for pagination in APIs /rules and /vrules #364

-   Add astronomic clock support to timed rules (included sunrise and sunset functions for EPL statements)
-   Timezone support in EPL statements
-   Support of NGSI filter to support updating to groups of entities (commands)
-   Upgrade Esper library from 6.1.0 to 7.1.0   !Probablemente versi√≥n 8
-   Software quality improvement based on ISO25010 recommendations
-   Enhanced multi-tenancy support. Leverage different "Fiware-Service" and "Fiware-ServicePath" in rules
-   Improve template processing, extending it to StructuredValue/JSON attributes.
-   Support for dealing with several Context Brokers from the same Perseo instance. To do so, update actions will
    support to configure target context broker, if not provided such configuration, the default context broker will be
    used.
-   Usage of EPL scripts beyond select statement
-   Task/set internal timer resolution #195
