-   Note we develop this software in Agile way, so development plan is continuously under review. Thus, this roadmap has
    to be understood as rough plan of features to be done along time which is fully valid only at the time of writing
    it. This roadmap has not be understood as a commitment on features and/or dates.
-   Some of the roadmap items may be implemented by external community developers, out of the scope of GE owners. Thus,
    the moment in which these features will be finalized cannot be assured.

## Short term

The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the short term, and incorporated in the next release:

-   "nosignal" actions supported in HA scenarios
-   Add astronomic clock support to timed rules (included sunrise and sunset functions for EPL statements)
-   Timezone support in EPL statements
-   Support of NGSI filter to support updating to groups of entities (commands)
-   Upgrade Esper library from 6.1.0 to 7.1.0
-   Full support for pagination in APIs /rules and /vrules
-   Explicit casting in EPL rules is no longer needed (full support of NGSIv2 based typing)
-   Software quality improvement based on ISO25010 recommendations
-   Enhanced multi-tenancy support. Leverage different "Fiware-Service" and "Fiware-ServicePath" in rules
-   Swagger documentation

## Medium term

The following list of features are planned to be addressed in the medium term, typically within the subsequent
release(s) generated in the next **9 months** after next planned release:

-   Improve template processing, extending it to StructuredValue/JSON attributes.
-   Support for dealing with several Context Brokers from the same Perseo instance. To do so, update actions will
    support to configure target context broker, if not provided such configuration, the default context broker will be
    used.
-   Rule scope beyond subservice: support dynamic creation of EPL context associated to notification path

## Long term

The following list of features are proposals regarding the longer-term evolution of the product even though development
of these features has not yet been scheduled for a release in the near future. Please feel free to contact us if you
wish to get involved in the implementation or influence the roadmap

-   Support for geospatial analysis (geo-fencing, point-based actions, movement-based actions)
-   Usage of EPL scripts beyond select statement
-   Rule templates (i.e. having a rule template that can be instantiated to create particular instances of the rule).
    The idea is be able to create complex rules only providing some parameters.
