- Upgrade uuid dep from ~1.4.2 to 9.0.0
- Remove unnecessary event data transformations (stripped, location parse, datetime parse) (#706, #712)
- Add support to run tests with node 18
- Set Nodejs 16 as minimum version in packages.json (effectively removing Nodev12 and Nodev14 from supported versions)
